1.1 ~P(a), ~P(f(b)), etc.  are ground negative literals, whereas ~P(x), ~P(f(x)), etc.  are non ground negative literals.
1.2 The first two formulae are sentences, the third is not because it has a free occurrence of the variable y.

2. A(x) (P(g(x)) \wedge f(g(x))=x \wedge \neg f(h(x))=x) .
(here g,h are unary Skolem functions).

3. The second and the fourth literals are flat.

4. See the course notes.
